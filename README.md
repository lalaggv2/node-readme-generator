# node-readme-generator

This applications idea is to help developers create a consistent readme for all their repositories by making them a series of questions and then creating the readme automatically at the end.

The questions are:
Title | Name of your repo |
| Description | Description of your repo |
| Table of Contents | Links to navigate to the different README sections |
| Installation | Instructions on how to install the dependencies for your repo |
| Usage | What is the expected use of this repo |
| License | What licenses does this repo have |
| Contributing | Who are the contributing authors |
| Tests | How do you run the tests on this repo (assuming that testing has been implemented) |
| Questions | Who does one contact for questions about the repo, and how?

It would also generate a badge (that can be personalized by the user) specific to this repository.
